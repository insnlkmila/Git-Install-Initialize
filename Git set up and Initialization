Git is a version control software for developers to manage every changes or version of the source code of the program by marked using a line mark or provides initialization for the changes or additions to code.

<ins>Git Initialization Tutorial</ins>

Initialization is carried out to ensure the latest version of the program code you enter is stored correctly. As we discussed before, Git serve as a version control for developers. Initialization also used to save a version of the program code to a new repository for you who are new to Git, so for the next changes you only need to create the initialization name according to your changes. Still confused? Let's get the steps for initializing Git:

1. Select the folder you want to initialize. Type **cmd** in your folder path, the cmd terminal will be displayed quickly in the specific folder you just opened. Don’t forget to click enter once you are done typing cmd in the folder path.

2. You can type **git init** as shown below. This stage is used to create a new repository. The message you got is initialized empty Git repository in D:/Sistem Arsip which means the new repository was created successfully. However, this repository is still empty.

3. Then type **git add .** to add new files to the repository. Files in the Sistem Arsip folder will automatically fill the repository. The example folder I use is a simple PHP programming system.

4. Type **git commit –m "initial commit"** to do Initialization of the first version. The successful initialization is shown below. If there is a change in the source code on your files, you can repeat points 2 and 3. You can replace the naming "initial commit" with the line according to the changes. For example "add system calculator", "change the login system" and other additions or changes.
